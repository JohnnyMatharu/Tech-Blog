# Description
An app for users to post ways in which they'd like to offer help or post volunteer opportunities. The main problems of people are being solved here, people can post what type of help they are looking for and people will leave their posts who wish to help or volunteer. Chances are that the person requesting is able to offer a reward to helper, but helper will firsthand ask for no money. Such a relationship may lead to permanent long term career bonds between people financially or non-financially.

This application uses MVC paradigm and Sequelize to create models. These models are used to create data groups to use handlebars to display final output to the user. User will see the blog posts with the comments on the homepage screen where user has to log in or sign up to add comment or edit the existing post

In order to run this app you will need to use your own database username and password with cookie secret, can save it in .env and change Server.js settings to take values from there. After this you may need to reinstall the NPM, Connect Session Sequelize, DotEnv, Express, Sequelize, MySql2, Handlebars, Bcrypt and Express Session. It also uses CSS to style
